The API notebooks are all executable! Hit "enter" in any code cell to execute it (and all cells before it that have not executed yet), or scroll to the bottom of the notebook and click "Play notebook". For more information, see [http://apinotebook.com](http://apinotebook.com).

#Considerations

- In order to run these notebooks you must register a PivotalTracker user. At some point of the excecution, you will be prompted to enter your API TOKEN which can be found in the very end of your PivotalTracker user profile.
- You must create a PivotalTracker account (which is not the same as PivotalTracker user) at [https://www.pivotaltracker.com/accounts](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/accounts).
- In order to test attaching Google Docs you have to integrate your PivotalTracker account with Google Apps as described [here](http://pivotallabs.com/integrating-your-tracker-account-with-google-apps/). Otherwise these tests will be skipped.
